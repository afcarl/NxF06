• OTHER ERROR MESSAGES 
The system and user messages described in this section pertain only to those messages generated 
by NX Nastran. Although these messages can appear at various places in the output 
stream, they should be easily identified by their format. The various computer operating systems 
also produce diagnostic messages that can appear at various places in the output stream. The 
format of these messages will vary with the operating system. Reference should be made to the 
operating system manuals for interpretation of the messages that are not generated by NX Nastran. 


System messages refer to diagnostics that are associated with program errors. In general, such

01 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 1, POSSIBLE ERROR IN DMAPINSTRUCTION *** INSTRUCTION NO. ***ASSUMED LAST INPUT DATA 
BLOCK IS NULL. 

User has specified N input data blocks when there should be N+1. A frequent avoidance is simply 
to add one more comma to the input list if the last input block doesn't exist. 

03 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 3, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION *** 
INSTRUCTION NO. ** FORMAT ERROR IN PARAMETER NO. ***. 

Double delimiter appears in parameter section of previous DMAP instruction. 

04 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 4, MPL PARAMETER ERROR, MODULE 
NAME = ******** PARAMETER NO. ***. 

MPL entry for module is incorrect. See block data program XMPLBD. 

06 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 6, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION *** 
INSTRUCTION NO. ** ILLEGAL VALUE FOR PARAMETER NO. ***. 

The type of parameter in DMAP instruction does not correspond to type requested in the MPL. 

For example, the location on the DMAP statement calls for an integer parameter and a real 
parameter has been entered.


 07 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 7, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** PARAMETER NO. *** NEEDS PARAMETER NAME. 

Parameter is not in correct format.

 08 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 8, BULK DATA PARAM CARD ERROR.
MUST NOT DEFINE PARAMETER NAMED ********. 

The "N" in V,N ******** means user cannot set the value of the parameter with name ******** on a 
PARAM card. 

In DMAP, when defining a parameter, the "N" in V,N ******** means user cannot set the value of 
the parameter with name ******** on a PARAM entry in Bulk Data.

 09 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 9, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** VALUE NEEDED FOR PARAMETER NO. ***. 

Constant needs value in a DMAP instruction or on a PARAM entry. There is a parameter in the 
referenced DMAP instruction which must have a value assigned before the execution of the module. 


10 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 10, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** ILLEGAL INPUT SECTION FORMAT. 

Too many or too few inputs are specified in the input for the referenced module. 

11 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 11, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** ILLEGAL OUTPUT SECTION FORMAT. 

Too many or too few outputs are specified in the input for the referenced module. 

12 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 12, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION NO. **
ILLEGAL CHARACTER IN DMAP INSTRUCTION NAME. 


Name of a module must be alpha-numeric characters, the first character being alphabetic. Special 
characters are not allowed. For example DMAP names like "8MOD" or "SETI=2" are not 
allowed. 

13 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 13, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** DMAP INSTRUCTION NOT IN MODULE LIBRARY. 

The named DMAP refers to a non-existent module name. Check spelling. 

14 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 14, ARRAY NAMED ******** OVERFLOWED. 


See XGPI module description in MFD section of Programmer's Manual. The usual cause is 
insufficient open core. In other cases, it may be necessary to divide the DMAP sequence into 
subDMAPs. 


15 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 15, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** INCONSISTENT LENGTH USED FOR PARAMETER 
NAMED ********. 

This parameter was used in a previous DMAP instruction which gave it a different type. See Section 
5.2.1 of the User's Manual. 

16 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 16, ILLEGAL FORMAT. 

Usually caused by early termination such as a LABEL without a NAME. 

17 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 17, UNIDENTIFIED NASTRAN CARD KEYWORD 
********. ACCEPTABLE KEYWORDS FOLLOW --- Compare your NASTRAN 
command to the list of acceptable keywords 

18 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 18, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** TOO MANY PARAMETERS IN DMAP PARAMETER 
LIST. 

Incorrect calling sequence for DMAP instruction. Compare the DMAP statement to the description 
in the User's Manual Section 5 or the Programmers Manual to find the error. 

19 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 19, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** LABEL NAMED ******** IS MULTIPLY DEFINED. 

LABEL named appears in more than one place in DMAP program. 

22 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 22, DATA BLOCK NAMED ******** MUSTBE DEFINED PRIOR TO THIS INSTRUCTION. 

See Section 5.2 of the User's Manual. Data blocks must be output before they can be input. 

A common mistake is to forget the DMAP statements DMIIN and DTIIN are required to read DMI 
and DTI matrices, respectively. Note that RF24D41 requires a DTIIN command (see Error 
Report 3734). 

24 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 24, CANNOT FIND FILE NAMED ******** 
ON DATA POOL TAPE. 

Contents of /XDPL/ do not match contents of Pool Tape. 

25 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 25, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** PARAMETER NAMED ******** HAS AN INCONSISTENT 
USER AUTHORIZATION. 


Parameter is referenced in nonfunctional module, but is nowhere defined. An example is COND 
LBL,X where X is not a variable parameter in a module before this statement. 

26 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 26, ERROR IN DMAP INSTRUCTION ***
INSTRUCTION NO. ** LABEL NAMED ******** NOT DEFINED. 

LABEL name does not appear in LABEL instruction. For example a COND,XXX statement 
appears without a LABEL,XXX statement. 


27 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 27, LABEL NAMED ******** NOT REFERENCED. 


LABEL name appears only in a LABEL instruction. It is not necessary to reference a LABEL. 

34 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 34, CANNOT TRANSLATE DMAPINSTRUCTION NO. ***. 

Error in subroutine XSCNDM. 

38 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 38, NOT ENOUGH CORE FOR GPI 

TABLES User must break up DMAP program. 
39 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 39, RIGID FORMAT DMAP SEQUENCE 
DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO MED TABLE. 

The MED Table must have the same number of entries as there are DMAP instructions in DMAP 
sequence. Can be caused by having more than one END DMAP statement. 

40 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 40, ERROR IN ALTER DECK - CANNOT 
FIND END OF DMAP INSTRUCTION. 

User should check ALTER part of the Executive Control Deck. 

41 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 41, TABLES INCORRECT FOR REGENERATING 
DATA BLOCK ********. 

File Name Table and MED Table used by routine XFLDEF are wrong. The user can compensate 
by altering OUT and IN module(s) which regenerate the data block. 

42 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 42, POSSIBLE ERROR IN DMAPINSTRUCTION *** INSTRUCTION NO. ** PARAMETER NAMED ******** 
ALREADY HAD VALUE ASSIGNED PREVIOUSLY. 

A DMAP instruction is attempting to assign a default value to a parameter that appears in a previous 
instruction which assigned it a value. 

43 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 43, INCORRECT FORMAT FOR NASTRAN 
CARD. 

NASTRAN statement format is wrong. Possibly a missing value or a real for an integer value. 

49 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 49, MPL TABLE (MODULE PROPERTIES 
LIST) IS INCORRECT. 

Error is in common block /XGP12/. 

51 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 51, NOT ENOUGH OPEN CORE FOR 
XGPIBS ROUTINE. 

Additional core memory is required to compile DMAP or rigid format. 

52 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 52, NAMED COMMON /XLINK/ IS TOO 
SMALL. 


There must be one word in LINK table for every entry in MPL. 

53 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 53, INCORRECT FORMAT IN ABOVE 
CARD. 

The link specification updated data (DIAG 28, 29, 30) is incorrect. 

54 *** THE PARAMETER IS NOT IN THAT SOLUTION OR VERSION. 

Use the PRTPARM DMAP statement to print acceptable parameter values for this solution and 
version. 

55 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 55, THE "SUBDAMP" KEYWORD CAN BEUSED ONLY ONCE PER SUBDMAP.

STATEMENT. 
72 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 72, PARAMETER SYNTAX ERROR IN
ABOVE STATEMENT. PARAMETER IS ******** --- ERROR CODE = ********. 


One possible occurrence of this error is when parameters are improperly defined on a CALL sub-
DMAP statement. 

If the value of a parameter is allowed to change in the called subDMAP, then it must be specified 


as S,XXXXX, where XXXXX is the parameter name. If it is specified as S,N,XXXXX, then error 
code 2 will occur pointing to a parameter named N. 

If a parameter field is left blank on a CALL subDMAP statement, then error code 2 will be improperly 
issued pointing to the last parameter in the command preceding the blank field. The correction 
for this is to place either a parameter name or value in the blank field. 

73 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 73, THE PARAMETER NAMED ******** IS

UNDEFINED.

This error may be issued in the following circumstances:

 1. 
The TYPE statement references an item which has not been defined in the NDDL. 
2. 
The NDDL stored in the user's MASTER dbset is inconsistent with the NDDL and DMAP stored 
in the delivery database; for example, a database created in Version 66 or 66A is being used in a 
Version 67 run. 
Another example of when this error will occur is when a user is accidentally attaching to an old 
database, because he has run multiple jobs with the same input filename, and he has also 
changed from a USS to SSS solution sequence or vice-versa. (e.g. SOL 24 to SOL 101).

XRCARD (which processes free-field input from the Executive and Case Control sections and 


DMAP) has detected one error. The message preceding this one explains the nature of the error. 
These preceding messages are as follows: 
*** INVALID DATA COLUMN 72. 
Column 72 cannot be data which requires continuation to one other physical entry. An example 
would be to have 1.E+ with the + in column 72. 
*** INTEGER DATA OUT OF MACHINE RANGE. 
The integer is larger than the largest integer allowed on this kind of a computer.

 *** INVALID CHARACTER FOLLOWING INTEGER IN COLUMN ***. 
Integers cannot start alphanumeric fields. Make sure that the first character is alphabetic. 
For example, the ID statement must begin with a letter, and cannot begin with a number.


 *** DATA ERROR --UNANTICIPATED CHARACTER IN COLUMN ***. 
The exponent field is incorrect. 
*** DATA ERROR MISSING DELIMETER OR REAL POWER OUT OF MACHINE RANGE. 
The number is larger than allowed for this machine. Ranges are specified in Section 1.3 of the 
NX Nastran Programmer's manual. 
*** HOLLERITH DATA ERROR STARTING IN COLUMN ***. 
Hollerith string extends beyond column 72. 


 *** ROUTINE XRCARD FINDS OUTPUT BUFFER TOO SMALL TO PROCESS CARD 
COMPLETELY. 


This is a programming error. The run should be forwarded to UGS. A possible avoidance is to 
shorten the number of items on the card.

See Bulk Data entry description in Section 2.4 of the User's Manual. One cause of this message 
is using a "D" before the exponent for a real number. Only "E" is allowed, unless noted otherwise 
on the Bulk Data entry description in Section 2.4. Another cause is placing a BCD variable in a 
real or integer field, such as using O when 0 is intended.

316 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 316, ILLEGAL DATA ON BULK DATA CARD

Typically this error is the result of incorrectly defining a material or element property. The most 
common error occurs on the PLATE property dialog box when the Memb-Bend Coupling is set to 
the same material as Transverse Shear and Bending. For most applications this item should be 
kept at the default setting of 0..None - Ignore. Only in situations where you want to model offsets 
of the PLATE’s midplane from the nodes should you consider Memb-Bend Coupling.

See Bulk Data entry description in Section 2.4. Often this is related to simply having the wrong 
type of input. For example, if the matrix type for input is declared as double precision, then all 
values must be of the form x.xxxD+yy, or double precision.

This may occur if BUFFSIZE is too large. See Section 7.6 of the Application Manual for maximum 
allowable value. 


This error may occur if the corresponding ASSIGN statement references an incorrect physical file 
specification. 

Another possible cause is to restart jobs trying to access (read/write) the same database simultaneously. 
DBLOCATing (read only) the same database by two jobs is acceptable. 

This error may also occur if there is an extra "=" sign within the parentheses of the LOGICAL 
statement (as incorrectly shown on page 2.2-14 of the Version 67 User's Manual). See Error 
Report 3668. 


Another cause is if a restart is attempted from a database in which the MASTER is split into multiple 
physical files. An avoidance is to explicitly point to the physical name associated with the 
MASTER DBsets on ASSIGN statements. See Error Report 2953.

it must be before all other Executive Control statements. 

520 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 520, CONTROL CARD **** IS MISSING. 
601 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 601, THE KEYWORD ON THE ABOVE

Case Control expects each command to begin with a keyword (usually 4 characters in length). 
To remove the error, consult the Case Control command descriptions, Section 2.3, and spell your 
request correctly. 

This occurs for SURFACE and VOLUME commands that are not in the OUTPUT(POST) section. 

602 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 602, TWO OR MORE OF THE ABOVECARD TYPES DETECTED WHERE ONLY ONE IS LEGAL. THE LAST FOUND

603 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 603, THE ABOVE CARD DOES NOT END 
PROPERLY. COMMENTS SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY A DOLLAR SIGN. 

Case Control commands of the form, name - value, should not contain more than one value. 
Consult the Case Control command descriptions, Section 2.3, for a complete description of the 
command or precede the comments with a dollar sign. 

604 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 604, THE ABOVE CARD HAS A NONINTEGER 
IN AN INTEGER FIELD. 

Consult the Case Control command descriptions, Section 2.3, for legal values. 

605 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 605, A SYMSEQ OR SUBSEQ CARD 
APPEARS WITHOUT A SYMCOM OR SUBCOM CARD. 

SYMSEQ or SUBSEQ commands must appear in a subcase defined by a SYMCOM or SUBCOM 
command. Check the Case Control and relabel the combination subcase. 


607 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 607, A REPCASE SUBCASE MUST BE PRECEDED 
BY A SUBCASE OR SYM SUBCASE. 

A REPCASE subcase is an attempt to reoutput the previously computed case, therefore, it cannot 
be the first subcase. 

608 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 608, THE SET ID SPECIFIED ON THE 
ABOVE CASE MUST BE DEFINED PRIOR TO THIS CARD. 

Set identification numbers must be specified prior to their use. Also sets specified within a sub-
case are valid only within that subcase. Redefine the errant set (or define a required set) or 
move the set out of the subcase it is in. 

609 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 609, SUBCASE DELIMITER CARDS MUST 
HAVE A UNIQUE IDENTIFYING INTEGER. 


SUBCASE commands must have an identifying integer. These numbers must be strictly increasing. 
The use of a nonblank delimiter (e.g., "="), or misuse of the MODES command will also 
cause this message to occur. The subcase ID plus the value on a MODES command which follows 
must be less than the value of the next subcase ID. An "=" sign after SUBCASE may be 
interpreted as a large integer. 

610 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 610, THE VALUE FOLLOWING THE EQUAL 
SIGN IS ILLEGAL. 

Case control cannot identify the value after the equal sign. Consult the Case Control command 
descriptions, Section 2.3. 

For example, only real data can follow SUBSEQ and SUBCOM commands--not integers. 

611 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 611, TEN CARDS HAVE ILLEGAL KEYWORDS. 
NASTRAN ASSUMES BEGIN BULK CARD IS MISSING. IT WILL 
NOW PROCESS YOUR BULK DATA. 

In Case Control, only ten key words may be misspelled. A common source of this error may be 
the omission of the OUTPUT(PLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT) delimiter commands. 

613 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 613, THE ABOVE SET CONTAINS 'EXCEPT' 
WHICH IS NOT PRECEDED BY 'THRU'. 

Only identification numbers included by the THRU keyword may be expected. Simplify the SET 
request. 

614 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 614, THE ABOVE SET IS BADLY SPECIFIED. 


Simplify the SET list. 

615 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 615, AN IMPROPER OR NO NAME GIVEN 
TO THE ABOVE SET. 

SET lists must have integer names. This SET list does not have one. SET 10 = is an example of 
the correct format. Give the SET a correct integer name. 

616 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 616, 'EXCEPT' CANNOT BE FOLLOWED BY'THRU'. LIST EXPLICITLY ALL EXCEPTIONS. 

EXCEPT in SET list can only be followed by integers. An integer larger than the THRU pair terminates 
the THRU. Either list exceptions explicitly, use two THRUs or terminate the first THRU. 

617 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 617, A NONPOSITIVE INTEGER APPEARS 
IN A POSITIVE POSITION. 

Most integer values in case control must be positive. The above command either has a negative 
integer or a character value in a positive position. See Section 2.3. 

619 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 619, SET MEMBER *** BELONGS TO ***

622 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 622, SET CONTAINING REAL NUMBERS 
MAY NOT USE THRU OR EXCEPT. 

Replace the THRU or EXCEPT range with a list of explicit real numbers. 

625 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 625, SUBCASE IDs MUST BE LESS THAN 
99,999,999. 

Reduce the size of the subcase identification number. Note also that character string subcase 
identification numbers are not legal. 

626 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 626, SUBCOM SUBCASE DOES NOT HAVE 
A SUBSEQ CARD. 

A SUBCOM SUBCASE must contain a SUBSEQ command to define the linear combination coefficients. 


627 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 627, THE ABOVE SUBCASE HAS BOTH ASTATIC LOAD AND A REAL EIGENVALUE METHOD SELECTION --REMOVE

XYPLOT error; see Section 4.3. 

If an XYPLOT command ends in a delimiter (i.e., comma or slash) then the next entry is 
assumed to be a continuation for that entry. This error often occurs when a command is longer 
than 72 characters. Any characters in columns 73 and on are ignored in the XYPLOT section.

spans multiple lines, and the INCLUDE keyword is the first word of the continuation, then NX 
Nastran thinks that is the INCLUDE command, thereby causing the error.

WITH SDR3 DESIGN. CODE = ****. 

This message appears when the SDR3 module encounters trouble. The exact nature of the 
problem can be detected from the "code" number. The file type causing the problem can be 
determined from its name (for example, OESi is the stress output file, and OUGVi the displacement, 
velocity, and acceleration output file). The function of this module is to convert SORT1 output 
tables to SORT2 tables. It operates on one output type per pass (for example, 
displacements, then velocities, then stresses in BAR elements, then ROD elements, etc.). Since 
the user controls the content and size of the output tables with case control and plot requests, it is 
often possible to avoid these errors, as described below. 

Codes Cause and User Action 110 Insufficient memory. Increase memory request, or 
decrease the number 140 of variables output on one run by using restarts for additional output. 
150 

The following codes should not occur on standard solution sequences. Please send any such 
runs to UGS. If they occur on user-written DMAPs, it is likely that an illegal input block is used, or 


that the input block is not correctly formatted. 


Codes Cause and User Action 100 The ID record is missing on the input file. 
120 101 Missing data record. 
102 Wrong number of words in input block. 
122 
112 The number of words per record is not an integer multiple of the number 142 of words per 
entry.

2021 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 2021, BAD GMMAT CALLINGSEQUENCE. 

The calling sequence of the subroutine which calls either subroutine GMMATD or GMMATS 
defined a nonconformable matrix product. The subroutine examines the transpose flags in combination 
with the orders of the matrices to make sure that a conformable matrix product is defined 
by this input data. This test clearly is made for purposes of calling routine checkout only. No

2025 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 2025, UNDEFINED COORDINATE SYSTEM 
****. 

The coordinate system identification number transmitted via ECPT(1) could not be found in the 
CSTM array. The user should check coordinate system numbers used on Bulk Data entries 
against those defined on CORD1C, CORD1R, etc., Bulk Data entries to insure that there are no 
undefined coordinate systems. 

This message can occur in superelement analysis when the CORD1x entry is in the Bulk Data 
entry. The cause is that grid points referenced on the CORD1x entry are not connected by elements 
in the superelement. An avoidance is to use the CORD2x formats, which reference points 
in space rather than grid points. 

This message also occurs frequently when using a non-UGS model generation program that 
places grid point identification numbers in the field used for material identification numbers by 
modern plate elements. See especially the CTRIA3 entry, field 7. 


2026 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 2026, ELEMENT **** GEOMETRY ORMATERIAL PROPERTY YIELDS UNREASONABLE MATRIX.

 Referenced element geometry and/or properties yield a numerical result which causes an element 
stiffness or mass matrix to be undefined. Possible causes include, but are not limited to, (1) 
the length of a rod or bar is zero because the end points have the same coordinates, (2) the sides 
of a triangle or quadrilateral are collinear which leads to a zero cross product in defining an element 
coordinate system, (3) the bar orientation vector is parallel to the bar axis, or (4) a shear 
panel has zero thickness or modulus. Check GRID Bulk Data entries defining element end points 
for bad data.

2101A *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 2101A, GRID POINT **** COMPONENT 
*** ILLEGALLY DEFINED IN SETS ****. 

The above grid point and component has been defined in each of the above dependent subsets. 
A point may belong to at most one dependent subset. This error occurs when a DOF is defined 
as belonging to two mutually exclusive sets (see User's Manual Section 1.4). 

A common example of this is if a DOF is defined as dependent on an MPC (M- set) and as being 
constrained (S-set) on an SPC entry. The message for this would state that the component was 
illegally defined in the UM (user-defined M- set) and US (User-defined S-set). These two sets are 
mutually exclusive in that all MPC equations are processed before the SPCs are applied (excep



tion SOL 24) and the M-set DOF have been removed from the matrix. When the program 
attempts to apply the SPC, the DOF is no longer available and the FATAL message is issued. 
The normal correction for this is to modify the MPC so that the DOF in question is independent 
(N-set). Then there is no conflict.

The matrix to be solved has a matrix trailer that indicates that it is symmetric ("FORM=6"). The 
DMAP call requests that the unsymmetric decomposition algorithm be used. The symmetric

symmetric, a MODTRL module call can be scheduled before the module to convert the matrix 
trailer to Form 6. If this message is encountered in a solution sequence, it is a signal that a solution

3001 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3001, ATTEMPT TO OPEN DATA SET 
*** IN SUBROUTINE ****** WHICH WAS NOT DEFINED IN FIST. 


Subroutine did not expect data block to be purged. Check data block requirements for module. 
See Section 6.3.1 for interpretation of this message. 

The FIST is the File Status Table. Files (input data blocks, in this case) are internally numbered-
the first one is 101, the second is 102, and so forth. UFM 3001 can be diagnosed by listing the 
DMAP and the contents of the database dictionary to see which input is missing. The subroutine 
listed in the message is expecting the file as input, and for some reason the file is purged or otherwise 
nonexistent (generally due to missing input). 

One kind of missing input occurs by forgetting to put the METHOD command in Case Control for 
modal transient or frequency response analyses. Another kind of missing data is to forget the 
SET command in the OUTPUT(POST) section. Yet another kind of missing data is to forget to put 
a FREQ, FREQ1, or FREQ2 in the Bulk Data for frequency response. 

Another way to get this message is to specify PARAM,OPTIM,NO in a SOL 200 that contains 
superelements, and there is no design model (see Error Report 3650). In SOL 200, one way to 
encounter this error is to have invalid RTYPE, PTYPE combinations. Another way is to request 
optimization with shape variables (see Error Reports 3543, 3585). 

Another way to get this message is to request output for anything other than the boundary point 
responses in SOL 118 (see Error Report 3581). Still another way is to have no constrained DOF 
in the model and to use the AUTO option on the TSTEPNL entry in nonlinear transient analysis. 
An avoidance is to use the ADAPT option on TSTEPNL (see Error Report 3644). 

This message has been seen in SOL 103 with Design Sensitivity Analysis-- material properties 
were incorrectly left out. 

Using CREEP with nonlinear-elastic materials (MATS1) will also give this message. CREEP 
works only with temperature-dependent materials. 


This message can occur in nonlinear analysis with no constrained DOF. 

Data in incorrect locations is another means of getting this message. For example, the OUTPUT(
POST) section must be below the subcase level. In addition, the SURFACE and VOLUME 
commands must be in the OUTPUT(POST) section, and not anywhere else. The SET referenced 
by the SURFACE or VOLUME commands must be defined prior to it being referenced. 

3002 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3002, EOF ENCOUNTERED WHILE

This message is issued when an End-Of-File occurs while trying to skip the header record. The

expects is missing. 

3003 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3003, ATTEMPT TO READ PAST THE 
END OF A LOGICAL RECORD IN DATA SET ********* (FILE ***) IN SUBROUTINE

This message is issued when the file is positioned at the beginning of a logical record and the

occur, for example, when using the arc length method (NLPCI entry) for enforced displacement 
problems. See Error Report 3737.

ENCOUNTERED WHILE PACKING DATA SET **** 3005 *** USER FATAL 
MESSAGE 3005, ATTEMPT TO OPERATE ON SINGULAR MATRIX **** INSUBROUTINE ****. 

Subroutine SDCOMP or subroutine UDCOMP has detected a singular matrix and the calling routine 
does not support this case. A User Information Message defining the singularity has already 
been printed. 

3007 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3007, ILLEGAL INPUT TO SUBROUTINE 
****. 

Subroutine **** has encountered data which it cannot process. This error should not be caused 
by user input data, except as described in the next paragraphs. A system or programming error 
is indicated. Go directly to the subroutine listing or description to determine the exact cause of 
the problems. 

This message occurs in superelement analysis when restarting improperly. The illegal input 
message is usually caused by a purged input file. 


One example is if the subroutine is CALCV. A common cause of this error is when attempting to 

perform a PARTN (or MERGE) on matrices with null partitioning vectors, or attempting to per


form UPARTN (or UMERGE) on a matrix for which the original set is the same size as the final 

set. In this case, the partitioning vector generated by the program is null and this error is gener


ated. In CALCV, if the DMAP partition "hard-coded" and the set does not exist, you'll get this 

error. For example, if a UPARTN module is using the Q-set, but the user hasn't used any Q set 

entries, this error will be issued. One remedy is to conditionally jump over the problem DMAP 

based on parameters such as NOQSET, NORSET, etc.

 This can also occur if inertia relief is not used properly in SOLs 91 or 101. Make sure that the 

rules stated in UM Vol 2 for inertia relief are followed. 

This has also been observed in SOL 129 models with initially closed GAPs that specify the 
ADAPT method on the TSTEPNL entry. It can be avoided by specifying the AUTO method 
instead. See Error Report 3733. 


3008 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3008, INSUFFICIENT CORE AVAILABLE 
FOR SUBROUTINE ********. 

This message implies that the particular subroutine does not have sufficient memory to meet its 
demands. The subroutine or module description should be consulted to determine the memory 
requirements. 


Refer to Section 7.6 of the Application Manual for instructions to increase the memory for the 
run. If an increase in memory is desired for only the module producing the error, an alter must 
be included in the Executive section of the input file. An example of the alter is included below. 


COMPILE DMAP=dmap,SOUIN=source $ source=MSCSOU or USRSOU ALTER # $ before 
module TYPE PARM,,I,N,MVAL $ 
MVAL = GETSYS(MVAL,57) PUTSYS(value1,57) $ value1=increased memory value ALTER # $ 
after module PUTSYS(MVAL,57) $ 
ENDALTER $ 


One cause observed for this in the Bulk Data SORT module is too many continuation entries. An 



avoidance is to have the Bulk Data already sorted and to increase available memory. See Error 
Report 2925. 

Also, large THRU ranges can cause excessive memory to be used.

to select data already in problem. Set zero (0) has a special meaning. A set selection

or larger than 1.0E-10 on the EIGRL entry when the REIGL module is used. The eigenvectors 
are not orthogonal to this extent. This nonorthogonality is especially important if a modal formulation

3055 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 3055, AN ATTEMPT TO MULTIPLY OR 


MULTIPLY AND ADD NON-CONFORMABLE MATRICES TOGETHER WAS 
MADE IN MODULE ******. 

The multiply/add subroutine requires conformable matrices. There are two possible equations 
1. X = A*B + C The number of columns of [A] must be equal to the number of rows of 

[B] the number of columns of [C] be equal to the number of columns of [B] and the number of 
rows of [C] must be equal to the number of rows of [A]. 
2. X = A(T)*B+ C 
The number of rows of [A] must be equal to the number of rows of [B] the number of columns of 

[C] must be equal to the number of columns of [B] and the number of rows of [C] must be equal to 
the number of columns of [A]. 
One cause of this is if the model in a cyclic symmetry analysis contains MPCs and only the zero 
harmonic is requested. This can be avoided by requesting an additional harmonic. See Error 
Report 3755.

an obsolete database is mounted. Perform the SEALL operation on the downstream superelement,

Otherwise, examine the RMS codes for a possible I/O error or other type of machine error. If it 
does not appear to be caused by local hardware problems, forward the run to the UGS programming 
staff. 



Another possible cause is that the disk is full. See Error Report 3161. 

Another possible cause is that the BUFFSIZE needs to be increased. See Error Report 3484. If 
this corrects the error, please notify UGS so it can be better documented. 

4276 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 4276, **** ERROR CODE **** 

This message occurs when NX Nastran encounters errors that are not otherwise trapped (including 
system errors). There are various Error Codes (EC), each of which has a different meaning. 
These Error Codes are described in Sections 6.3.11 and 6.3.12. 

In nearly every case, the log file will contain further information about the problem, so you should 
look there for further clues. In addition, because these are errors that most likely should have 
been caught in another manner (and with a more explicit error message), you should look at the 
recent Error Reports (search for "4276"). 

In many cases, increasing memory, BUFFSIZE, or disk space will resolve the problem. This is 
especially true when attempting to run large models on workstations. 


SFM 4276 is issued when GPERR is called. The name refers to the subroutine calling GPERR 
and the error code is specific to that subroutine. 

On CRAY/UNICOS computers an attempt is made to trap the error and print a diagnostic and an 
error number. More information may be obtained by using the following command: "man 2 intro." 

Possible causes of this error are listed in ascending order by Error Code. Note that some are for 
older versions of NX Nastran, but they may still be of help.

 EC 4 

1. This has been observed on V66 on Cray X-MP COS. It can be avoided by increasing MFL and 
MEM. 
EC 93 

1. This has been observed in V66B on the IBM MVS/XA. It can be avoided by setting the MEM 
and BUFFPOOL to zero. 
EC 100 
1.This has been observed when MATMOD is operating on a null matrix.


 EC 105 

1. This occurs when there are no mass properties and SOL 3 is run with dynamic reduction. 
EC 201 

1. If the lF value on a Cray UNICOS is set to a value larger than the allowable value, then the job 
may fail with this Error Code. 
EC 211 

1. If this is a large job and it fails in the PLTVEC module with an SEUPPLOT request, then it is 
most likely related to Error Report 2609. This error has been noticed by clients, but UGS has 
been unable to reproduce it. Send your input file to UGS. 

2. Incorrect data on the PSOLID entry (specifically, placing the FCTN input in a field other than 8). 
See Error Report 3752. 
k EC 240 

1. This is due to insufficient space in the DEB array. This error should only occur on the IBM VM/ 
CMS V65* or prior systems. The DEB array size can be increased by modifying the site code 
information on the NASTRAN EXEC run-time procedure from 'MY_SITE' to 
'MY_SITE,DEB=xxx'. 
EC 301 

1. This has been seen when the LOGICAL keyword on the DBLOC statement did not refer to the 
MASTER dbset. 
EC 302 

1. This has been observed when a BUFFSIZE has been specified that is larger than allowable. 
EC 304 

1. Possible causes of this error are insufficient disk space (especially for IBM machines) and too 
small a BUFFSIZE--check both. Insufficient disk space should show up as a "device full" error in 
the log file. 
2. Another possible cause is a bad block on your disk pack. 
3. Another possible cause is too little memory (especially for "decomp"). 
EC 923 
Your system resources (disk space or maximum file size) have been exceeded. 
Possible causes include: 

1. Insufficient disk space. This is usually accompanied by a "device full" 
type error on most Unix machines and a B37 or E37 type jess log messages on the IBM MVS/XA 
and MVS/ESA. 
2. This has also been observed when a BUFFSIZE that is larger than the maximum allowable on 
a particular machine is used. Reduce the BUFFSIZE to an acceptable value. 
3. On the IBM MVS/XA, a possible cause is insufficient pool space. 
Increase the space allocation on the pool DD statement. 
4. On Unix machines, if the ulimit is exceeded, then this Error Code may be issued. In most 
instances, "errno = 27 " will also appear in the log file. 
The avoidance is to increase ulimit. 
5. On Cray UNICOS, the lf and lF parameters may need to be increased. 
EC 1039 

1. Possible cause of this error is insufficient disk space. 
EC 1044 


1. Required DBSETs are offline. Make sure that all required DBSETs are either in the same location 
that they were originally created or use full assignment statements. 
2. If it is SOL 99 restart run, make sure that the restart file contains "param,loopid,x". 
3. The model contains PCOMP entries and there is no corresponding MAT8 
k entry. 
4. This has been seen in a nonlinear run with superelements, with no elements in the residual 
structure. The fix is to put at least one element in the residual. 
EC 1102 

1. If the job fails in the DCMP module and SOL 24 is used, make sure that the sequencer is 
turned on. 
EC 1401 

1. If the job contains a user DMAP with INPUTT2, make sure that the first parameter ITAPE is not 
set to a value of "-5" to "-8". This is documented as General Limitation 2303. 
2. Using the same matrix twice as input to a DMAP module can cause this message. See Error 
Report 3640. 
3. Do not use BUFFPOOL options -1 or -3. See Error Report 3796. 
EC 1404 

1. A possible cause is a ulimit that is too small. 
2. Another possible cause is that the BUFFSIZE needs to be increased. 
EC 1409 

1. This will occur in SOL 200 if the analysis model properties and stress recovery locations are 
specified with DVPREL1 relations; DVPREL2 relations should be used. See Error Report 3551. 
EC 1604 

1. This was observed for SOL 144, 145, and 146 restarts from a database processed by 
DBTRANS. See Error Report 3739. 
EC 1802 

1. Large jobs with small memory and BUFFSIZE have shown this. 
EC 3001 

1. This error can occur if system(119) is set to "-3". This is most likely to occur on an IBM MVS/ 
XA system. Use the default value of "-2" for system cell 119. 
2. Check for missing design optimization entries. 
EC 3002 

1. This can occur if FBS Method 2 is executed with insufficient scratch space. Method 2 requires 
more scratch space than Method 1, so you can force Method 1 or 1A or increase the amount of 
scratch space. 

 EC 3003 

1. Using the ARC method for enforced displacement problems. See Error Report 3737. 
EC 3006 

1. Insufficient memory or BUFFSIZE. 
k 2. Placing the TEMP(LOAD) command above the SUBCASE command in a buckling analysis. 
The avoidance is to place the TEMP(LOAD) command within the first subcase. See Error Report 
3646.

 EC 4276 

1. Placing the RESTART statement above the NASTRAN statement. 
EC 7777 
This error code often indicates machine underflow or overflow, though it is impossible to list specific 
reasons for this error code. Observed problems have included: 

1. One possible cause is a modeling problem. This is usually accompanied by an "arithmetic 
fault, floating overflow" type message in the log file on some machines. Perform a static analysis 
and verify that the value for the maximum diagonal ratio is acceptable. 
2. If SEALL=ALL is used when generating component modes, and "read only" 
type commands are used to attach the database for subsequent residual structure analysis, then 
the job may fail with this error. Either remove the "read only" type restriction, or use SEALL=x 
with x being the superelement number. This error is most likely to occur with external superelement 
type analysis. On the VAX, the log file may also contain error message "access violation 
fatal error". 
3. This error code has also been observed when requesting large amount of output and there is 
insufficient disk space for the f06 file. 
4. Non-default values of TOUT on the DMIG entry can also cause this error on some machine. 
Use the default value of TOUT set by machine precision. 
5. Missing an ENDDATA entry at the end of the file can also cause the error. 
6. Bad geometry on a CBEND will cause this message to be issued by EMG. 
See Error Report 3539. 
7. Defining loads for transient heat transfer analysis using TLOAD2 instead of TLOAD1 also 
gives this error. 
8. Using the INV method for complex eigenvalue extraction when the search region contains 
roots that approach machine infinity. Choose a different search region or use a different extraction 
method. 
9. Requesting plot labels for acoustic HEXA elements. 
10. Restarting a model with PCOMP entries that use the SYM option. See Error Report 3669. 

11. Using a comma in a WHERE clause. See Error Report 3749. 
12. In a superelement analysis with multiple subcases, if the boundary conditions are changed in 
successive subcases this message will occur after the OLOAD output for the preceding sub-
cases. (Cray UNICOS) 
13. If the option PLOTFORM=3 is used in the VECPLOT module and the input datablock 
INVECT is purged, then this error mat occur. This error has been observed for some problems 
on a Cray k and is most likely to occur with user DMAP that uses VECPLOT. The avoidance is to 
generate a null input matrix for INVECT. 

14. This has also been observed when a large (1.0E32 or greater) value of G1,Z and/or G2,Z 
was used on a MAT8 entry.

For the system solution, an exit is taken if eigenvalues are requested but not eigenvectors. 
Reset the "range of frequency" and/or the "number desired" on the EIGR or EIGRL entry. 
If the superelement does not have any eigenvalues in the range of interest, remove the CMS 
request for that particular superelement. 


This message is also issued when the eigenvectors calculated with a transformation method 
such as Givens do not pass internal orthogonality checks. This is indicative of a modeling error. 


This message can also be issued if insufficient memory is available for Lanczos with sparse

During decomposition, the degrees of freedom listed had pivot ratios greater than MAXRATIO. 
Verify that the degrees of freedom are not part of a mechanism or rigid body mode and that elements 
do not have excessive stiffness relative to nearby elements. In superelement analysis, 
this will cause run termination.

One or more modules has found a fatal error condition. 
A message is printed for each fatal error condition. 
They have set a flag, which causes this message to be printed at the end of the run. Error messages 
may occur anywhere in the output, so you should search your output for these errors 
(search for FATAL). 


This message is most likely when PARAM,ERROR,0 is used. However, this error will be issued in 



superelement analysis if User Warning Message 4698 is also issued. 

In cyclic symmetry analysis, if no eigenvalues are found in the prescribed frequency range on the 
EIGR or EIGRL entry for the current harmonic, the run will not continue to the next harmonic and 
the message will result. Instead of selecting a frequency range, input the desired number of

4505 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4505, THE LIMIT OF 90 DEGREES ONGIMBAL ANGLE Y HAS BEEN EXCEEDED FOR POINT SIL = *****. 

In large displacement analysis the rotational degrees of freedom are represented by gimbal 
angles. The transformations at angle = 90 become singular. To avoid the problem choose the 
local Z axis for large angle motion. 

Sometimes the gimbal angle has nothing directly to do with this message. 
In nonlinear models with plate elements, a small or undefined value of K6ROT has caused this 
message. Increase the value of K6ROT. Note, there has been a change in the default of K6ROT 
in the nonlinear solutions in the past few versions, so this may not necessarily apply to V67. If this 
is the cause, then this message occurs within the first few iterations. 

Another possible way to avoid this message is to decrease the size of the load increment. This 
will avoid a large incremental change in the gimbal angle.

4540 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 4540, INPUT ESTNL DATA BLOCK ISNOT NONLINEAR FORMAT. 

The EST data block which was submitted to the nonlinear iteration module was not in the correct 
format. This implies that the nonlinear appendages were nonexistent and no computations can 
be performed. (This is detected by the fact that the second trailer word for linear EST data blocks 
is a zero, and it is non-zero for nonlinear appendage format.) Make sure that the DMAP has the 
correct EST data block as the input to the NLITER module. 


4542 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4542, NO LOAD INCREMENT EXISTSFOR NONLINEAR SUBCASE. 

The DELPLV data block, which is the incremental load vector for the subcase, was null. This

met, the modes are orthogonalized but the checking function is not performed. However, all outputs 
from the module are provided. If the check is desired, the user should either increase memory 
or decrease the number of eigenvectors to meet the above equation. 
4562 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4562, TSTEP (TIME STEPS) DATA IS

For certain pathological problems, the transformation method may fail. In UGS testing, this has 
occurred only for problems with multiple real roots or complex conjugate roots with zero-real 
components. Avoidances are to add a small damping or stiffness term, to add degrees of freedom, 
or otherwise perturb the problem to separate the roots on the real axis or move them into 
the complex plane. 

4568 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4568, THE NUMBER OF SPECTRUMS

The DLOAD Bulk Data entry is used for an unconventional purpose in response spectrum analysis. 
It is required, and is used to place a scaling factor on each coordinate with enforced motion. 
Each of these coordinates must also be on SUPORT Bulk Data entries. (Reference NX Nastran 
Application Manual, Section 2.15.3.5). 
Change the number of pairs of Si, Li entries to match the number of coordinates where enforced 
motion occurs.

(3) avoid the resequencing operation by use of PARAM,NEWSEQ,-1. 
4574 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4574, DATA RECOVERY STARTED BUTNO DISPLACEMENT VECTORS AVAILABLE. 

The SDR1 module has begun to expand the displacement vector from solution set size to g-set

input. If only enforced displacements are desired, add a very small load to produce a load 
vector. 

This message may also occur in a non-superelement unstructured solution sequence if SEALL, 
SEMG, SELG, SEKR, SELR, or SEMP are used in the Case Control.

4645 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4645, THE SHIFTED STIFFNESS MATRIXIS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE. 

The matrix sum K + lambda*M is given a Cholesky decomposition at the start of the modified Givens 
Method of eigen solution. This requires that the matrix be positive-definite. Conditions that 
prevent this are massless mechanisms (for example, a point mass on an offset with no rotational 
stiffness), or stiffness matrices derived from geometric nonlinear analysis that are in a highly 


post-buckled state. 

4646 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4646, THE MASS MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE 
DEFINITE, USING THE GIV METHOD. USE MGIV INSTEAD. 

The reduced mass matrix has columns that are not linearly independent. Common causes are 
rotation degrees of freedom whose only inertia terms result from point masses on offsets. Use 
the MGIV method instead, as it does not require a positive definite mass matrix. 

4647 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4647, INSUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE

The module where the program terminated is listed. If the time to completion appears 
reasonable, the user should increase the estimates on the TIME statement and resubmit the run. 
For large models, an increase in the system region request should also be considered. 

4648 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4648, THE MODAL MASS MATRIX ISNOT POSITIVE DEFINITE. 

The modal mass matrix cannot be decomposed by Cholesky algorithms after merging elastic and 
free-body modes. 
(The Cholesky decomposition is used to orthogonalize the eigenvectors with respect to the mass 
matrix.) Causes include input of negative masses, and calculation of eigenvectors for eigenvalues 
approaching machine infinity. Inspect the model, or ask for fewer eigenvectors by use of the 
F2 option. When this condition occurs, the eigenvectors are not orthogonalized or normalized. 
The second parameter of the READ module is given a negative sign. This parameter is used in 
the solution sequences to branch to an error exit after printing the real eigenvalue table. 
The user may schedule a DMAP alter to print these eigenvectors, if the cause of the problem is 
not apparent in the eigenvalues. The solution can be forced to completion by changing the sign 
of this parameter. 
The user should be aware that a poor quality of solution is provided for this case. It may be useful 
for diagnosing the problem, but should not be used for other purposes. 

The error can occur when large offsets (large relative to the element length) are used for the 
BEAM element and coupled mass has been selected. See Error Report 3647.

4683 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4683, (***) MATRIX NEEDED FOR EIGENVALUE 
ANALYSIS. 

The eigen solution module was given a purged (that is, non-existent) mass, stiffness, or differen



tial stiffness matrix. Common causes include deletion of mass density input on MATi entries, 
user restart errors in the superelement solution sequences or when the auto-selection feature of 
Generalized Dynamic Reduction (GDR) determines that there are no natural frequencies below 
FMAX. It therefore sets the number of generalized coordinates to zero. This condition can be 
detected from User Information Message 4181. An avoidance is to increase FMAX on the 
DYNRED Bulk Data entry. Provide mass matrix generating data by any of several means, including 
a mass density entry on material entries, concentrated masses, and G-type DMIG entries. 

A possible cause of this is specifying a Q-set but not requesting GDR. When this is done, if no 
other A-set dof are specified, a static condensation of the matrices is performed, reducing the 
problem to the Q-set, which will contain no mass or stiffness. 
Avoidance: specify a Q-set only when GDR is requested. 

Possibly no mass matrix has been defined. Check for: 

RHO entry on MATi NSM entry on element properties (i.e., PSHELL, PBAR) 

CONMi or CMASSi NX Nastran needs at least one of the above to compute the mass matrix. 

Incorrect cross-sectional properties may also lead to this error but would typically show up as 

another error. 

In buckling analysis, an absence of loads, or loads that cause no stress, can lead to this message. 
The message will state that no mass matrix is present, but this really means that the differential 
stiffness matrix is missing. Print the stresses from the static solution to insure that they are 
proper. 
This can occur in buckling when there is no output request in Case Control for the static subcase 
(in which case the geometric stiffness matrix is not formed). 

This can also occur if a job is restarted from SOL 101 to SOL 103 and the SOL 101 run contains 
a TEMPD entry. 

This can also occur if the DBLOCATE statements are not in the correct order.

economical than the coupled algorithms. Coupled algorithms are required when any of the following 
effects are present: transfer functions, DMIG requests of the Ptype, element damping, 
and PARAM,G. 


Consider use of modal damping (TABDMP1 entry) to reduce the cost of analysis.

See the V67 Numerical Methods User's Guide, Chapter 6. 

This error may also occur when using the large mass method and F1 = 0.0 
or is left blank. A possible avoidance is to specify a small negative number for F1 (typically -1.0) if 
rigid-body modes are present. If the fatal error occurs with a small negative value for F1, make 
the F1 value even more negative. If rigid-body modes are not present, try using a small positive 
value of F1. 


This can also occur for models with two or more widely separated groups of repeated roots; an 
avoidance is to search each group separately. See Error Report 3035. 

This error may also be caused by a massless mechanism, which can be confirmed by performing 
a static analysis.

Guide. 

The message is given from the REIGL module, which performs a necessary (but not sufficient) 
check on the positive semidefiniteness of the indicated matrix. 

Something has caused a negative term on the diagonal of the mass or stiffness matrix. Look for 
explicitly defined negative mass and/or stiffness terms. Also, check the continuation entries on 
the PBEAM entry. 
An incorrect entry for the SO field may lead to improper mass definition. 
For example, if SO is set to NO at a particular X/XB location, the continuation entry for defining 4 


stress locations on the cross-section (C, D, E, F) is not used. If SO is NO, but the C, D, E, and F 
points are entered in error, negative mass terms could result if either E1 or E2 entries are 
entered. The offending DOF can be traced using the USET Tables. 

The Lanczos method gives wrong answers for indefinite matrices. The existence of negative 
diagonal terms indicates a subclass of indefinite matrix. 


In dynamic analysis, look for evidence of negative mass, such as minus signs on input. Negative 
terms on the factor of the indicated matrix must be removed for correct answers. 

In buckling analysis, look for input that causes negative stiffness terms. This should cause diagnostics 
during the static analysis phase.

ELEMENT ID = *****. THE (TAPER/SKEW) IS (GREATER/LESS) THAN THERECOMMENDED (MAXIMUM/MINIMUM) VALUE OF (0.5/30 DEG.). 

Bad geometry can cause incorrect answers for QUAD4 elements. 
The bad geometry warning may be neglected if the element is in a non-critical part of the model, 
or if the element stress is constant. 
If the element is in a critical part of the model, you are advised to refine your model so these bad 
geometries do not occur. 



Skew and taper are representative of the amount that a QUAD4 deviates from being rectangular. 

Skew is the angle between the lines that join opposite midsides. 
When this angle is less than 30 degrees the message is issued. 
For no skew this angle is 90 degrees. 


Taper is computed as follows: Connect opposite grid points and compute the area of the 
enclosed triangles. Ji is 1/2 of the area associated with grid i and the adjacent grids of the 
enclosed triangle. Ja is 1/4 of J1+J2+J3+J4. If |(Ji-Ja)/Ja| exceeds 0.5 then the message is 
issued. (The equation equals 0.0 if there is no taper.) Another way to think of taper is the ratio of 
the areas on the two sides of a diagonal; if the ratio is greater than 3, then the taper test fails. 

Note that these tests concern only geometry, and are made prior to the analysis. Another useful 
test, made after the analysis, is the stress discontinuity calculation.

alters where datablocks are being stored permanently on the database. If an EQUIV is done on

can occur. A more confusing case occurs when all qualifiers for a permanent datablock 
are not TYPEd as NDDL parameters, or are not passed into the current subDMAP. When an

also printed after a converged solution, when the arc length may change due to restoration after 
bisection, or due to the DESITER field on the NLPCI entry. 

6189 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6189, *** REPEAT ITERATION,
STOPPING AT LOWEST ERROR. 

This is issued when the time/load/arc-length increment has already reached its minimum limit 
and the solution has not converged, though the maximum number of iterations has been performed. 
If the best iteration is not the last iteration, a reiteration is done to obtain the best solution. 


6190 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6190, *** MAXIMUM NUMBER OFCONTROLLED INCREMENTS (MXINC) HAS BEEN EXCEEDED ***. 

In the arc-length control methods, the number of solution steps actually completed in a subcase 
is usually different from that specified by the user. 
Therefore, its limit is controlled by MXINC. 


No action is necessary if the solutions exceed the desired extent. Otherwise, increase the value 
of MXINC on the NLPCI entry. 


6191 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6191, *** DIVERGING SOLUTION 
LIMIT ***. 

The solution has diverged twice consecutively during the iteration.

value of MAXDIV on the NLPARM or TSTEPNL entry. Alternatively, increase NINC on the 
NLPARM entry or decrease DT on the TSTEPNL entry. 


6192 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6192, *** NO ROOT CASE HAS

activated. 

6193 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6193 (****), *** MAXIMUM NUMBER

In nonlinear transient analysis, the minimum allowable time step has been reached. In nonlinear 
static analysis, with Newton's method, the minimum allowable load step has been reached or, 
with the arc-length method, the minimum allowable arc length has been reached. 

Change the stiffness matrix update strategy (METHOD) or increase the value of MAXBIS on the 
NLPARM or TSTEPNL entry. Alternatively, increase NINC on the NLPARM entry or decrease DT 
on the TSTEPNL entry. 

6194 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 6194, *** STOPPED ITERATIONSDUE TO (***)

on the NLPARM or TSTEPNL entry.

Data entry is printed after this message. 

6411 *** SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 6411 (LSQRD). SINGULAR VALUE 
DECOMPOSITION DID NOT CONVERGE. 

This message is issued by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method which is used by the 
curve-fitting algorithm for the hyperelastic material constants. The message occurs when the 


SVD fails to converge, which may be caused by an error in the experimental data. Check the 
input in the TABLES1 Bulk Data entries for errors. 


6412 *** SYSTEM WARNING MESSAGE 6412 (LSQRD).

RANK DEFICIENCY HAS BEEN DETECTED. RANK =****. FULL RANK =**** This message is 
issued by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method which is used by the curve-fitting 
algorithm for the hyperelastic material constants. The message occurs when the least squares 
problem for estimation of the material parameters is rank deficient, i.e., the rank is less than the 
number of material parameters (full rank). This message may be issued for either distortional 
(Aij) or volumetric (Di) parameter fitting. 

The program will proceed to find a non unique solution. However, it is best to try to avoid rank 
deficiency by providing more experimental data for curve fitting or lowering the order of the strain 
energy polynomial, NA or ND in the MATHP Bulk Data entry.

6417 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 6417 (SQD41D/S), THE (CUBIC)
OPTION FOR STRESSES IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR NONLINEAR ELEMENTS. 

USER INFORMATION: STRESS(CENTER) WILL BE APPLIED TO THOSE ELEMENTS. 

CUBIC refers to corner output for element STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE. 
Corner output is not available for nonlinear analysis, so only center stresses are computed for 
nonlinear QUAD4 elements. 


6418 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 6418 (SDR2A), THE CUBIC OPTIONFOR (STRESSES/STRAINS) OVERRIDES ALL OTHER OPTIONS IN THE 
(STRAIN/FORCE) COMMANDS. 

CUBIC refers to corner output for element STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE. 
When corner output is selected for QUAD4 elements, only one output type--CORNER or CEN-
TER--is available in the entire run, regardless of output request (STRESS, STRAIN, and 
FORCE) and subcase. The hierarchy is as follows: 


1. STRESS in the first subcase determines the request type (CENTER or CORNER). 
2. STRESS above the subcase level determines the type. 
3. STRAIN in the first subcase determines the type. 
4. STRAIN above the subcase level determines the type. 
5. FORCE in the first subcase determines the type. 
6. FORCE above the subcase level determines the type. 
The second (and successive) subcases are not used to determine output type (CENTER or 
CORNER).

When requesting corner output for QUAD4 elements, all membrane thicknesses at the four grid 
points must be greater than zero. If any thickness is zero, then stresses, forces, and strains are 
not computed for that element. Subsequent element computations--such as grid point stresses 
and stress discontinuities-- will not have results from the offending elements.

This is issued if there is insufficient opencore (memory) available. Instead of stopping, however, 
the run may continue with additional iterations. It is recommended that the memory be increased 
and that a single iteration be tried to see that there is enough memory. Or, use the DSCREEN 
entry to reduce the number of retained constraints (by regionalization or truncation).

The above summary of changes is automatically printed on restart to indicate which elements 
have been involved in the matrix update operation. 


*** MODEMG FATAL ERROR---FORM=1 AND FORM2 ELEMENT MATRICES 
ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY MODEMG 

An attempt has been made to restart and update a matrix from an older version of NASTRAN. It 
is necessary to regenerate all matrices on a current system. 

*** MODTA LOGIC ERROR 

This is a fatal message in the program. The complete run should be sent to the programming

*** SDCOMP FATAL ERROR---LEADING MINOR OF DATA BLOCK ******** IS 
SINGULAR AT COLUMN******* DECOMPOSITION ABORTED. 

impossible to continue symmetric decomposition if the leading minor is singular. The user should 
check for singularities in the matrix. 

*** SDCOMP INFORMATION MESSAGE---DATA BLOCK ******* HAS ZERO 
DIAGONAL TERMS AT COLUMN 

The decomposition can proceed in the presence of zero diagonal terms as long as the leading 
minor is nonsingular. 
This condition should cause concern if only structural elements are present, since zero diagonal 
terms are unlikely if there are other terms in the column. This condition can occur if Lagrange 
Multiplier techniques are used. 

*** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE---PASSIVE COLUMNS TERMINATED

*** USER WARNING MESSAGE---ROW ******** OF LOW. TRI. FACTOR HAS 
DIAGONAL TEM=0 (OR. LT. 0 IF CHOLESKY) 

If standard decomposition is used, a zero term implies the row listed is the last degree of freedom 
in a mechanism. If Cholesky decomposition is used, the row listed is at the end of a block that 
contains a non-positive definite minor. See Section 7.5 of the NX Nastran Application Manual for 
a discussion of this theory and avoidance techniques. 
Depending on the context, a user fatal message with more specific information usually follows 
this warning message. 

*** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE---SUBSTITUTED FOR DIAG. TERM OF

If a zero diagonal is generated during the decomposition, the default action is to place a small 
number on the diagonal and continue the decomposition.

Abnormal Termination NX Nastran may terminate as a result of errors detected by the operating 
system or by the NX Nastran code. lf DIAG 44 is set, then NX Nastran will produce a dump when 
most of the errors occur. The purpose of these remarks is to aid the user in interpreting the output 
which accompanies these types of errors. 
An example of this type of output with some commentary is presented on the following pages.
